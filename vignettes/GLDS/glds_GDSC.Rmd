This script provides an example of how to control for GLDS in pre-clinical biomarker discovery. Controlling for GLDS is important because
variability in GLDS is evient in cancer cell lines, and controlling for this variability improves cancer biomarker discovery.

Apply completeMatrix()
```{r}
#if (!require("BiocManager"))
#  install.packages("BiocManager")
#BiocManager::install('TCGAbiolinks')

library(glmnet)
library(pRRopheticplus)

#Set parameters of completeMatrix()
nPerms=50
senMat=read.table("./drug_matrix.txt", header=TRUE, row.names=1)

#Apply completeMatrix()
#This function will create a file called complete_matrix_output.txt in your working directory.
#This file is used as in put in the next function.
completeMatrix(senMat=senMat, nPerms=nPerms)
```
